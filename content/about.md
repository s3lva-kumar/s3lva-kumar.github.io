Welcome to my About page! My name is Selvakumar and I am a DevOps Engineer based in India.

I have always been passionate about DevOps and Security, and I have been fortunate enough to turn that passion into a successful career. With 1 year 6 months of experience in the field, I'm honing my skills and developing a deep understanding of  DevOps work.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients, from individuals to large corporations. My approach is always tailored to the unique needs and goals of each client, and I am committed to delivering exceptional results that exceed expectations.

In addition to my work, I am also passionate about Cyber Security.

One of the things that sets me apart as an DevOps is my commitment to build secure infra and automate everything. I believe that [Your Beliefs or Philosophy], and I strive to embody these principles in everything I do.

I am grateful for the opportunities I have had in my career, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities. If you would like to learn more about me or my work, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
