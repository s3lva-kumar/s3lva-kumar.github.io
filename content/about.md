Greetings! This is Selvakumar and you have landed on my About page. As a DevOps Engineer based in India.

I am deeply passionate about DevOps and Security, and I feel fortunate to have converted that passion into a successful career. I have gained 1 year and 6 months of experience in this field, where I have honed my skills and developed a profound understanding of DevOps tools and Cloud providers.

Apart from my professional work, I enjoy learning Cyber Security and Network, which is another one of my passions.

As an DevOps Engineer, I strongly believe in certain principles like a positive attitude, effective communication, cooperation, productivity, and teamwork. I strive to implement these principles in everything I do, which sets me apart in this field.
